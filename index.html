    <h1>MyMedi</h1>

    <div>
      MyMedi was developed in close corporation to nurses, patients and doctors.

      MyMedi will help you keep on track with your intake behavior and your medicine. It can remind you on intakes, manage your medicine info's and create graphic statistics to get you the best possible overview over your demands.

      To make it as easy as possible to protocol your intakes, you can pin a tile to your start screen who will take you directly to the intake wizard.

      To ensure the safety of Your Data, there is a backup function build in who let you save your data to OneDrive. Also there will be support for the OS Backup who is introduced with Windows Phone 8.1.
